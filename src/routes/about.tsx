              Ever wondered how many ways you can say "zzzz"? We did! So, we built this little linguistic playground. Think of it as a global pillow fight, but with words.

              We're a motley crew of language lovers and sleep enthusiasts (yes, that's a job title now). Our mission? To showcase the beautiful, bewildering, and downright hilarious ways humans express the universal concept of slumber.

              Each "sleep" you submit adds a thread to our collective word cloud. It's a visual symphony of snoozing, a testament to the world's shared need for a good night's rest. Plus, you might just learn a new word to impress your sleepy friends.
